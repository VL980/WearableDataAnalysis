# WearableDataAnalysis
Repository for Getting and Cleaning Data Final Project

Note - Comments included in the run_analysis code detail the function of each block of code.

The project consists of only a single project file called run_analysis.R, which carries out all the transformations and produces the .txt file with the tidy data set. The CodeBook.md file explains all the transformations and the variables.
